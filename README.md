# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-Model


In this project, I extracted Apple Inc stock data for a span of 5 years and used deep learning model LSTM to predict prices for next 30 days.


Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning.


The approach to this project was to segregate the data into model training data and test data to check the versatality of the model.
